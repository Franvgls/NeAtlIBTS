\title{Map of hauls (stations) from an IBTS survey taken directly from DATRAS}
\usage{
SurveyMap.IBTSbl(
  Survey,
  Year,
  Quarter,
  ti = TRUE,
  leg = TRUE,
  legpos = "bottomright",
  colhaul = "yellow",
  ICESrect = FALSE,
  ICESlab = FALSE,
  ICESlabcex = 0.7,
  graf = FALSE,
  xpng = 800,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{Survey}{Code to plot. Has to be one of those available from DATRAS survey list, and from a year and quarter avalable}

\item{Year}{year data to plot}

\item{Quarter}{quarter data to plot}

\item{ti}{TRUE includes the Survey Year Quarter title by default, a text includes the txt as title}

\item{leg}{TRUE includes a legend with the country-sweeplength-colors codes}

\item{legpos}{Position of the legend, by default bottomright, (bottomleft, upperleft...)}

\item{colhaul}{choose the color for the bg of the haul if country and sweeplngth are False}

\item{graf}{if FALSE the graph goes to screen, if its a file name (i.e. "graf") a file with that name is created and a message with location (wd) is shown in screen}

\item{xpng}{width file png if graf is the name of the file}

\item{ypng}{height file png if graf is the name of the file}

\item{ppng}{points png parameter if graf is the name of the file}

\item{country}{if TRUE hauls have different colors by country, useful only for NS where there are different countries}

\item{sweeplngt}{if TRUE haul symbols change with different sweeptlengths. Useful to check if sweep lengths and depths math}

\item{Depth}{if TRUE includes the depth of each haul, useful to check if it matches sweep length used}
}
\value{
Presents the map with the stations and a legend with the countries that have participated in the survey
